# Cearting Table in SQL 


I've started learning SQL since 3 months ago and during this time creating a portfolio was my biggest concern. At the end, after a lot of searching and watching Youtube videos, came up with the idea of creating table which I guess is the simplest task of SQL. 

In the following picture, I created a table with different data types: Int= is integer which is for numbers , Nvarchar just accepts string and 50 means you write upto 50 character
