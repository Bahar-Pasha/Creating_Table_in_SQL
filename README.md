# Cearting Table in SQL 


I've started learning SQL since 3 months ago and during this time creating a portfolio was my biggest concern. At the end, after a lot of searching and watching Youtube videos, came up with the idea of creating table which I guess is the simplest task of SQL. 

In the following picture, I created a table with different data types: Int= is integer which is for numbers , Nvarchar just accepts string and 50 means you write up to 50 character, then we defined primary key for the first column and default value for "Date" Column which will be automatically filled by " (getdate())" when entering data.

## Foreign Key

When we want to linke one table to another one, then do it through Primary key and Foreign key. It acutally gives rise to  having consistent data in our database.

## Constraints 
For constraints, we define some conditions that should be met while entering data. Here, we applied a condition for EndD (END DATE) column which should be greater than StartD or it can be empty.

## Index 

Indexes are used to retrieve data from the database more quickly than otherwise. ACS: Sorts the result set in ascending order.
